### READ ME FIRST ###

This OSF page contains Matlab code to run the Particle Metropolis
within Gibbs (PMwG) and Density Tempered Sequential Monte Carlo 
(DTSMC) algorithms developed in:

Gunawan et al. New estimation approaches for the linear ballistic accumulator
model.

The two directories, PMwG and DTSMC, each contain a README file. These
two README files provide brief information about all scripts contained in
each of the PMwG/DTSMC directories. We recommend consulting the README
files prior to using the scripts.
